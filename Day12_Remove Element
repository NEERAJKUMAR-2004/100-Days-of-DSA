LeetCode Problem #27: Remove Element

Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. 
The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Note:
- Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
- The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
        return k

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
